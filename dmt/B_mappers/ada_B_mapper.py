This is the implementation of the code mapper for Ada code.
As initially envisioned, ASSERT technology is not supposed
to support manually-made systems. A migration path, however,
that allows legacy hand-written code and modelling-tool
generated code to co-exist, can be beneficial in allowing
for a smooth transition. To that end, this backend (as well as
the C one) are written.

This is a backend for Semantix's code generator B (aadl2glueC).

Ada is a member of the asynchronous "club" (SDL, etc);
The subsystem developer (or rather, the APLC developer) is using
native Ada code to work with code generated by modelling tools.
To that end, this backend creates "glue" functions for input and
output parameters, which have Ada callable interfaces.
